# EBPhaseField
Code repository for the paper "A phase-field model for the brittle fracture of Euler-Bernoulli beams coupling stretching and bending", authors G. Corsi, A. Favata and S. Vidoli.
Submitted to CMAME

## Dependencies
* legacy FEniCS (with PETSc): latest version **2019.2.0.dev0** from the repository was used 
* meshio, pygmsh, gmsh, pandas python packages

## Contents
Two scripts are provided:
* Euler-Bernoulli beam fracture (clamped_clamped_beam_CDG.py): the damage model introduced in the paper is demontrated. The application is the case of a beam clamped at both sides
* 2D beam fracture (frac_clamp_2D.py): a 2D phase-field damage model is used to obtain the numerical evidences shown in figure 13 of the paper (fracture of a cantilever beam-like domain under strong compressions).

## Usage
* *python3 clamped_clamped_beam_CDG.py -d 2e-4  -p 0.12*             (-d fixes the transverse load increment each step, -p is equivalent to $\bar{q}$ introduced in section 4 of the article)
* *python3 frac_clamp_2D.py -nnc -1.0*                               (-nnc fixes the compression ratio  $N/N_c$ see article for details)
